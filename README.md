Introdcution 

Looking at previous examples and having a life long interest in storytelling and gaming I decided to make a text adevnture.
Idea: A text adventure set in space where you name and create a character and have three encounters while on a spaceship. The game follows standard RPG mechanics such as health, usable items and dice rolls to do certain actions in the style of Dungeons and Dragons.

I started off with a map of the starting room and three rooms with three connecting corridors.
